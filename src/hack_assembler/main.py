# Make a dictionary called variables that map labels and variables to their address
# Go through the file.asm line by line and copy only valid instruction and replace labels and variables with their corresponding number, output this file as file.o
# Use the CPU Emulator to test the output of file.o
# Convert file.o to file.hack, then delete file.o
